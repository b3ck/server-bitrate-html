# server-bitrate-html
##### Simple HTML / Javascript webpage that shows current bitrate of desired NGINX/NMS RTMP & DOCKER-SLS-SRT servers.

### Use the combined version in the [/ALL_SERVERS/](https://github.com/b3ck/server-bitrate-html/tree/master/ALL_SERVERS) directory.

---
I've added two different variations of this:
- [StreamElements](https://github.com/b3ck/server-bitrate-html/tree/master/streamelements) to be used as a custom widget in a StreamElements overlay.
- [python script](https://github.com/b3ck/server-bitrate-html/tree/master/python) to be used inside of OBS Studio.
