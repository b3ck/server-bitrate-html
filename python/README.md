Here is a python script that you can use with OBS Studio if you have Python installed, I used 3.11 with this, let me know if you have any questions,
this is a work in progress, I've only tested it with Belabox Cloud, NGINX and RIST, feel free to test with other server types and let me know if they work, don't work
