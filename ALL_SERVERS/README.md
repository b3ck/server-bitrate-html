# How to edit and use `bitrate.html`:

# Configure the way the script fetches the bitrate:

## Line 127; 
The following line configures the interval the script fetches all of the bitrates from the server stats pages in the array, this is in milliseconds, so 2000 would equal 2 seconds.
```javascript
const interval = 2000;
```


## Lines 129-131;
## Modify the following lines to match your server(s) setup, make your changes accordingly, please note you can add in as many servers you want to the server array, example you could have 4 different srt, nms, nginx servers;

Line 129; if you're using SRT this would be your `streamid`, in the example below 'publish/live/feed1', if you do not want to show RTT then change 'rtt: true' to 'rtt: false'
```javascript
{ server: "SRT", page: "http://127.0.0.1:8181/stats", key: "publish/live/feed1", rtt: true },
```

Line 130; if you're using NMS this would be your `application` + `key`, in the example below 'live' is the application and 'feed1' is the key (this also includes the default password to access the NMS server stats page).
```javascript
{ server: "NMS", page: "http://admin:admin@localhost:8000/api/streams/live/feed1" },
```

Line 131; if you're using NGINX this would be just your `key`, so if you go with the default, it would be 'live'
```javascript
{ server: "NGINX", page: "http://localhost/stat", key: "live" }
```

# Configure the way it looks:

## Modify line 114 to change how it looks when there is NO incoming bitrate:

Default for line 114 will show nothing.
```javascript
el.innerHTML = null;
```

### Here are some examples:
Example #1; this will show: `0`
```javascript
el.innerHTML = `0`;
```

Example #2; this will show: `NO SIGNAL`
```javascript
el.innerHTML = `NO SIGNAL`;
```

Example #3; this will show: `WHATEVER`
```javascript
el.innerHTML = `WHATEVER`;
```
---
## Modify line 119 to change how it looks when there IS incoming bitrate:

Default for line 119 will show: `XXXX kb/s`.
```javascript
el.innerHTML = `${bitrate} kb/s`;
```

### Here are some examples:
Example #1; this will show: `bitrate: XXXX kb/s`
```javascript
el.innerHTML = `bitrate: ${bitrate} kb/s`;
```

Example #2; this will show: `blah blah XXXX kb/s`
```javascript
el.innerHTML = `blah blah ${bitrate} kb/s`;
```

After everything is configured correctly and edited to your liking, save it and add the `bitrate.html` as a browser source in OBS.

Make sure to add it as a local file:
